            <p>
              The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their
              pieces alternately on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The
              player with the white pieces commences the game. A player is said
              to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king
              ‘under attack’ in such a way that the opponent has no legal move.
              The player who achieves this goal is said to have ‘checkmated’ the
              opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king
              under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also
              ’capturing’ the opponent’s king are not allowed. The opponent
              whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the position is such that neither player can possibly
              checkmate, the game is drawn.

            <p>
              The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares
              alternately light (the ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’
              squares). The chessboard is placed between the players in such a
              way that the near corner square to the right of the player is
              white.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured
              pieces (the ‘white’ pieces); the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces
              (the ‘black’ pieces).

            <div>
              <p>These pieces are as follows:</p>

            <p>
              The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The
              eight horizontal rows of squares are called ‘ranks’. A straight
              line of squares of the same colour, running from one edge of the
              board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’.

            <p>
              It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a
              piece of the same colour. If a piece moves to a square occupied by
              an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and removed from the
              chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an
              opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square
              according to the Articles 3.2 to 3.8. A piece is considered to
              attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving
              to that square because it would then leave or place the king of
              its own colour under attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it
              stands.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on
              which it stands.
            </p>
            <img
              class="oneImage"

              alt="rook"
            />
            <p>
              The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a
              diagonal on which it stands.
            </p>
            <img
              class="oneImage"
              src="/resources/css/img/pos4.png"
              alt="queen"
            />
            <p>
              When making these moves the bishop, rook or queen may not move
              over any intervening pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which
              it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.
            </p>
            <img

              alt="knight"
            />
            <p>
              The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in
              front of it on the same file, or on its first move the pawn may
              move as in 3.7.a or alternatively it may advance two squares along
              the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or the pawn
              may move to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, which is
              diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that
              piece.
            </p>
            <img
              class="oneImage"

            />
            <p>
              A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent’s pawn which has
              advanced two squares in one move from its original square may
              capture this opponent’s pawn as though the latter had been moved
              only one square. This capture is only legal on the move following
              this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.
            </p>
            <img
              class="oneImage"
              src="/resources/css/img/pos7.png"
              alt="pawns"
            />
            <p>
              When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position
              it must be exchanged as part of the same move on the same square
              for a new queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same colour. The
              player’s choice is not restricted to pieces that have been
              captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is
              called ‘promotion’ and the effect of the new piece is immediate.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two different ways of moving the king: by moving to any
              adjoining square not attacked by one or more of the opponent’s
              pieces
            </p>
            <img
              class="oneImage"
              src="/resources/css/img/pos8.png"
              alt="king"
            />
            <p>
              or by ‘castling’. This is a move of the king and either rook of
              the same colour along the player’s first rank, counting as a
              single move of the king and executed as follows: the king is
              transferred from its original square two squares towards the rook
              on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the
              square the king has just crossed.

              moving to that square because they would then leave or place their
              own king in check. No piece can be moved that will either expose
              the king of the same colour to check or leave that king in check.

              ‘Chess clock’ means a clock with two time displays, connected to
              each other in such a way that only one of them can run at one
              time. ‘Clock’ in the Laws of Chess, means one of the two time
              displays. Each time display has a ‘flag’. ‘Flag fall’ means the
              expiration of the allotted time for a player.

          <hr />
          <article>
            <p>
              In the course of play each player is required to record his own
              moves and those of his opponent in the correct manner, move after
              move, as clearly and legibily as possible, in the algebraic
              notation, on the scoresheet prescribed for the competition. A
              player may reply to his opponent’s move before recording it, if he
              so wishes. He must record his previous move before making another.
              Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a player is unable to keep score, an assistant, who must be
              acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to write
              the moves. His clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an
              equitable way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter throughout the
              game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scoresheets are the property of the organisers of the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a player has less than five minutes left on his clock at some
              stage in a period and does not have additional time of 30 seconds
              or more added with each move, then for the remainder of the period
              he is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1.
              Immediately after one flag has fallen the player must update his
              scoresheet completely before moving a piece on the chessboard.
            </p>

                  If neither player is required to keep score, the arbiter or an
                  assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this
                  case, immediately after one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall
                  stop the clocks. Then both players shall update their
                  scoresheets, using the arbiter’s or the opponent’s scoresheet
                </li>
                <li>
                  If only one player is not required to keep score, he must, as
                  soon as either flag has fallen, update his scoresheet
                  completely before moving a piece on the chessboard. Provided
                  it is the player’s move, he may use his opponent’s scoresheet,
                  but must return it before making a move.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must
                  reconstruct the game on a second chessboard under the control
                  of the arbiter or an assistant. He shall first record the
                  actual game position, clock times and the number of moves
                  made, if this information is available, before reconstruction
                  takes place.

            <p>
              If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a
              player has overstepped the allotted time, the next move made shall
              be considered as the first of the following time period, unless
              there is evidence that more moves have been made.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the conclusion of the game both players shall sign both
              scoresheets, indicating the result of the game. Even if incorrect,
              this result shall stand, unless the arbiter decides otherwise.

              checkmate cannot occur by any possible series of legal moves. This
              immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing this
              position was legal.

              A ‘quickplay finish’ is the phase of a game when all the
              (remaining) moves must be made in a limited time.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the player, having the move, has less than two minutes left on
              his clock, he may claim a draw before his flag falls. He shall
              summon the arbiter and may stop the clocks.

                  If the arbiter agrees the opponent is making no effort to win
                  the game by normal means, or that it is not possible to win by
                  normal means, then he shall declare the game drawn. Otherwise
                  he shall postpone his decision or reject the claim.

                  If the arbiter postpones his decision, the opponent may be
                  awarded two extra minutes and the game shall continue, if
                  possible in the presence of an arbiter. The arbiter shall
                  declare the final result later in the game or as soon as
                  possible after a flag has fallen. He shall declare the game
                  drawn if he agrees that the final position cannot be won by
                  normal means, or that the opponent was not making sufficient
                  attempts to win by normal means.

              Unless announced otherwise in advance, a player who wins his game,

              game, or forfeits scores no points (0) and a player who draws his

              Players are not allowed to leave the ‘playing venue’ without

              smoking and other places as designated by the arbiter. The player
              having the move is not allowed to leave the playing area without

              his clock.
