        	    <p>"I have known many chess players, but among them there has been only one genius - Capablanca!
                His ideal was to win by manoeuvring. Capablanca's genius reveals itself in his probing of the opponent's weak point. The slightest weakness cannot escape from his keen eye."<br>
                <em>World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker</em></p>
                <p>"Capablanca's play produced and still produces an irresistible artistic effect.
                In his games a tendency towards simplicity predominated, and in this simplicity there was a unique beauty of genuine depth."<br>
                <em>World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinik</em></p>
                <p>"The ideal in chess can only be a collective image, but in my opinion it is Capablanca who most closly approachess this...His book was the first chess book thet I studied from cover to cover. Of course, his ideas influenced me."<br>
                <em>World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov</em>
